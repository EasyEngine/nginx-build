NGINX WebDAV missing commands support (PROPFIND & OPTIONS)

(c) 2012 Arutyunyan Roman (arut@qip.ru)


For full WebDAV support in NGINX you need to turn on standard NGINX 
WebDAV module (providing partial WebDAV implementation) as well as 
this module for missing methods

./configure --with-http_dav_module --add-module=<path-to-this-module>



Requirements:

	libexpat-dev


Example config:

	location / {

		dav_methods PUT DELETE MKCOL COPY MOVE;
		dav_ext_methods PROPFIND OPTIONS;

		root /var/root/;
	}
