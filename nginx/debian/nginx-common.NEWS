nginx-common (1.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with this release, we have enabled PIE build features which allows
  Address Space Layout Randomization. This is a hardening feature that
  prevents some potential security issues.

  While this will significantly help increase security, it can potentially cause
  significant performance issues on i386 systems.

nginx-common (1.6.2-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  We have disabled SSLv3 in nginx.conf for security reasons (ref: POODLE),
  don't forget to re-enable it if your site depends on it.

  In this release we also include a summary of important changes since wheezy
  at /usr/share/doc/nginx-common/README.Debian.

nginx-common (1.6.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with this release, we changed the default document root from
  /var/www to /var/www/html, so that sensitive files from other virtual hosts
  wich are typically put into some directory below /var/www are not exposed by
  the default virtual host.

nginx-common (1.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  As of nginx-1.6.1-2 we have synced all configuration files with upstream and
  we plan to keep them in sync from now on.

  Unfortunately that might break existing configuration for some users. Please
  check the matrix below for more information:

  File            Changes
  -----------------------
  koi-win         whitespace
  koi-utf         whitespace
  mime-types      whitespace, changed js/rss mime type,
                  minor other changes & additions
  scgi_params     whitespace, added HTTPS
  uwsgi_params    whitespace, added HTTPS, removed UWSGI_SCHEME
  fastcgi_params  whitespace, removed SCRIPT_FILENAME
  fastcgi.conf    new upstream configuration file

  Fastcgi configuration issues
  ============================

  nginx shipped a modified `fastcgi_params`, which declared `SCRIPT_FILENAME`
  fastcgi_param. This line has now been removed. From now on we are also
  shipping fastcgi.conf from the upstream repository, which includes a sane
  `SCRIPT_FILENAME` parameter value.

  So, if you are using fastcgi_params, you can try switching to fastcgi.conf
  or manually set the relevant params.

  You might also want to read the documentation section before proceeding.

  http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html
  section: $fastcgi_script_name variable.

nginx-common (1.4.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Per CVE-2013-0337 (bug #701112), we are changing /var/log/nginx permissions
  to root:adm 750. If you have manipulated these permissions in any way, you
  can add a dpkg-statoverride entry and the directory will not be touched.
  You also have to manually set the permissions once, as dpkg doesn't do that
  automatically for directories.

  e.g.
    chown root:adm /var/log/nginx
    chmod 0755 /var/log/nginx
    dpkg-statoverride --add root adm 0755 /var/log/nginx

nginx (1.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  Started with nginx 1.4.1-2 upload, nginx-naxsi-ui switched backend from
  MySQL to SQLite.

  This was mostly caused by the future removal of MySQL support in naxsi-ui.
  Thus, the nginx maintainers decided to switch from MySQL to SQLite.

  All data contained in the MySQL database is not affected by this switch but
  you need to start with a clean SQLite database to ensure nginx-naxsi-ui
  reliability.

nginx (0.8.53-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As stated by upstream, the 0.7.x branch is consedered legacy and 0.8.x will
  be the new stable branch. For this reason, the nginx maintainers decided to
  upload 0.8.53 to unstable.

nginx (0.7.59-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As stated by upstream, the 0.6.x branch is consedered legacy and 0.7.x will
  be the new stable branch. For this reason, the nginx maintainers decided to
  upload 0.7.59 to unstable.

  Should you get the following error while starting nginx:

    could not build the server_names_hash, you should increase
    server_names_hash_bucket_size: 32

  Please add the following parameter to your nginx.conf:

    server_names_hash_bucket_size 100;

  Where 100 is the size of your server names hash bucket. For more information
  about this option, please read the following resources:

    http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpCoreModule#server_names_hash_bucket_size

nginx (0.6.30-2) unstable; urgency=low

  As of May 4th., nginx 0.5.x branch is considered legacy and 0.6.x will
  be the new stable branch. The announcement was made by Igor Sysoev when
  releasing the last 0.5.x version, nginx 0.5.36.

  Debian, the universal operating system, has provided binary packages for
  both 0.5 and 0.6 branches in unstable and experimental, and will now offer
  only 0.6 packages in the unstable distribution, starting with the
  0.6.30-1 package.

  In the future, Debian will also provide experimental packages for the
  next testing branch of nginx, at the moment upstream announces it.

  Should you have any problem with nginx in Debian, please file a bug in
  the Debian Bug Tracking System.
