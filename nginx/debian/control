Description: small, but very powerful and efficient web server and mail proxy
 Nginx (engine x) is a web server created by Igor Sysoev and kindly provided to

 and as a reverse proxy server before some Apache or another big server to
 reduce load to backend servers by many concurrent HTTP-sessions.
 .
 This is a dummy package that selects nginx-full by default, but also can be
 installed with nginx-light for upgrading to nginx-light directly.
