  * Resynchronise with Debian unstable.  Remaining changes:

      + Display a system restart required notification on libssl1.0.0
        upgrade on servers.
      + Use a different priority for libssl1.0.0/restart-services depending
        on whether a desktop, or server dist-upgrade is being performed.
    - debian/{libssl1.0.0-udeb.dirs, control, rules}: Create
      libssl1.0.0-udeb, for the benefit of wget-udeb (no wget-udeb package
      in Debian).

      rules}: Move runtime libraries to /lib, for the benefit of
      wpasupplicant.
    - debian/patches/perlpath-quilt.patch: Don't change perl #! paths under
      .pc.
    - debian/rules:
      + Don't run 'make test' when cross-building.

      + Fix Makefile to properly clean up libs/ dirs in clean target.
      + Replace duplicate files in the doc directory with symlinks.
    - Unapply patch c_rehash-multi and comment it out in the series as it
      breaks parsing of certificates with CRLF line endings and other cases
      (see Debian #642314 for discussion), it also changes the semantics of
      c_rehash directories by requiring applications to parse hash link
      targets as files containing potentially *multiple* certificates rather
      than exactly one.
    - debian/patches/tls12_workarounds.patch: Workaround large client hello
      issues when TLS 1.1 and lower is in use
    - debian/control: Mark Debian Vcs-* as XS-Debian-Vcs-*

      the new functions.
    - AES-NI support (Closes: #644743)
  * pic.patch: upstream made OPENSSL_ia32cap_P and OPENSSL_cpuid_setup
    hidden on amd64, no need to access it PIC anymore.
  * pic.patch: Make OPENSSL_ia32cap_P hidden on i386 too (Closes: #663977)
  * Enable hardening using dpkg-buildflags (Closes: #653495)
  * s_client and s_server were forcing SSLv3 only connection when SSLv2 was
    disabled instead of the SSLv2 with upgrade method.  (Closes: #664454)
  * Add Breaks on openssh < 1:5.9p1-4, it has a too strict version check.

  * libssl0.9.8.postinst: Call set -e after sourcing the debconf
    script.
  * libssl0.9.8.postinst: Change list of service that may need

openssl (0.9.8a-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Call pod2man with the proper section.  Section changed
    from 1/3/5/7 to 1SSL/3SSL/5SSL/7SSL.  The name of the files
    already had the ssl in, the section didn't.  The references
    to other manpage is still wrong.
  * Don't install the LICENSE file, it's already in the copyright file.
  * Don't set an rpath on openssl to point to /usr/lib.
  * Add support for kfreebsd-amd64. (Closes: #355277)
  * Add udeb to the shlibs.  Patch from Frans Pop <aragorn@tiscali.nl>

    (Closes: #350249)
  * Change the debconf question to use version 0.9.8-3
    instead of 0.9.8-1, since that's the last version
    with a security fix.
  * Call conn_state() if the BIO is not in the BIO_CONN_S_OK state
    (Closes: #352047).  RC bug affecting testing, so urgency high.

openssl (0.9.8a-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove empty postinst/preinst/prerm scripts.  There is no need
    to have empty ones, debhelper will add them when needed.
  * Remove the static pic libraries.  Nobody should be linking
    it's shared libraries static to libssl or libcrypto.
    This was added for opensc who now links to it shared.
  * Do not assume that in case the sequence number is 0 and the
    packet has an odd number of bytes that the other side has
    the block padding bug, but try to check that it actually
    has the bug.  The wrong detection of this bug resulted
    in an "decryption failed or bad record mac" error in case
    both sides were using zlib compression.  (Closes: #338006)

openssl (0.9.8a-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Call dh_makeshlibs with the proper version instead of putting
    it in shlibs.local, which doesn't seem to do anything.  0.9.8a-1
    added symbol versioning, so it should have bumped the shlibs.
    (Closes: #338284)
  * The openssl package had a duplicate dependency on libssl0.9.8,
    only require the version as required by the shlibs.
  * Make libssl-dev depend on zlib1g-dev, since it's now required for
    static linking. (Closes: #338313)
  * Generate .pc files that make use of Libs.private, so things only
    link to the libraries they should when linking shared.
  * Use -m64 instead of -bpowerpc64-linux on ppc64. (Closes: #335486)
  * Make powerpc and ppc64 use the assembler version for bn.  ppc64
    had the location in the string wrong, powerpc had it missing.
  * Add includes for stddef to get size_t in md2.h, md4.h, md5.h,
    ripemd.h and sha.h.  (Closes: #333101)
  * Run make test for each of the versions we build, make it 
    not fail the build process if an error is found.
  * Add build dependency on bc for the regression tests.

openssl (0.9.8a-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Link to libz instead of dynamicly loading it.  It gets loaded
    at the moment the library is initialised, so there is no point
    in not linking to it.  It's now failing in some cases since
    it's not opened by it's soname, but by the symlink to it.
    This should hopefully solve most of the bugs people have reported
    since the move to libssl0.9.8.
    (Closes: #334180, #336140, #335271)
  * Urgency set to high because it fixes a grave bug affecting testing.

openssl (0.9.8a-2) unstable; urgency=low

    and causes a segfault.  (Closes: #334501, #334502)

openssl (0.9.7g-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    * Added support for proxy certificates according to RFC 3820.
      Because they may be a security thread to unaware applications,
      they must be explicitely allowed in run-time.  See
      docs/HOWTO/proxy_certificates.txt for further information.
    * Prompt for pass phrases when appropriate for PKCS12 input format.
    * Back-port of selected performance improvements from development
      branch, as well as improved support for PowerPC platforms.
    * Add lots of checks for memory allocation failure, error codes to indicate
      failure and freeing up memory if a failure occurs.
    * Perform some character comparisons of different types in X509_NAME_cmp:
      this is needed for some certificates that reencode DNs into UTF8Strings
      (in violation of RFC3280) and can't or wont issue name rollover
      certificates.
  * corrected watchfile

     certificate signature with the NULL public key.

openssl (0.9.7b-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * upstream security fix
   - Countermeasure against the Klima-Pokorny-Rosa extension of
     Bleichbacher's attack on PKCS #1 v1.5 padding: treat
     a protocol version number mismatch like a decryption error
     in ssl3_get_client_key_exchange (ssl/s3_srvr.c). (CAN-2003-0131)
    (closes: #189087)
   - Turn on RSA blinding by default in the default implementation
     to avoid a timing attack. Applications that don't want it can call
     RSA_blinding_off() or use the new flag RSA_FLAG_NO_BLINDING.
     They would be ill-advised to do so in most cases. (CAN-2003-0147)
   - Change RSA blinding code so that it works when the PRNG is not
     seeded (in this case, the secret RSA exponent is abused as
     an unpredictable seed -- if it is not unpredictable, there
     is no point in blinding anyway).  Make RSA blinding thread-safe
     by remembering the creator's thread ID in rsa->blinding and
     having all other threads use local one-time blinding factors
     (this requires more computation than sharing rsa->blinding, but
     avoids excessive locking; and if an RSA object is not shared
     between threads, blinding will still be very fast).

openssl (0.9.7a-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * upstream Security fix
    - In ssl3_get_record (ssl/s3_pkt.c), minimize information leaked
      via timing by performing a MAC computation even if incorrrect
      block cipher padding has been found.  This is a countermeasure
      against active attacks where the attacker has to distinguish
      between bad padding and a MAC verification error. (CAN-2003-0078)
