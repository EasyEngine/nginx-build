 == Generation of the php5-dbg package Depends ==

The following command can be used to generate a heuristic list of
packages the php5-dbg package probably needs to Depend on:

dh_testdir && egrep '^Package' debian/control | cut '-d ' -f2 | \
	egrep -v '(^php5|dbg|dev|common|pear)$' | tr "\n" "|" | sed 's/|$//' |\
	sed -r 's/([^|]+)(\||$)/ \1 (= ${binary:Version}) \2/g'; echo

 == Making some sense out of the configure options  ==

The COMMON_CONFIG variable contains the configure options that are to
be used on all the SAPIs. Built-in extensions and other general options
should be set here.
The shared extensions are built when building the apache2 SAPI and as
such they need to be specified there.
The calls to configure for the other SAPIs usually only need
--without-foo when the extension or feature is otherwise enabled by
default.

 == The *modulelist files ==

When building a new module (or extension) on an individual binary
package, it must be added to the debian/modulelist file. However, if
the extension is to be included in an existing binary package, it
must be added to the debian/extramodulelist file.

The format of these files is:
"<package name> <fancy name, one word> <extension name>"

E.g. for, if we want the mysql extension to be shipped in the
php5-mysql package we use:
"mysql MySQL mysql"
But we also want mysqli and the PDO in the same package, so we add the
following lines to extramoduleslist:
"mysql MySQLi mysqli
mysql MySQL_PDO pdo_mysql"

 == More debian/rules foo ==

* The shared extensions are built under the apache2 target (see above).
* The CLI SAPI is built on the build-cli-stamp AND build-cgi-stamp, with
  different configure options.
