Using PHP 5 with threaded webservers (e.g. apache2-mpm-worker)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  After much back-and-forth with upstream (and even building our
  packages thread-safe for a while), we're currently admitting defeat
  on that front, and are NOT building any thread-safe versions of PHP
  5 for any webservers. Our recommendation is that, if you need to use
  a threaded webserver, you should use php5-fpm and interface to your
  webserver with FastCGI.

Problems starting Apache HTTP Server with PHP 5
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  At the time of writing, there are no *known* incompatibilities
  between any of the PHP 5 modules we ship. However, there have been
  many bug reports in the past due to dynamically-loaded extensions,
  and it's possible there are still bugs in the released packages. If
  Apache fails to start after you install PHP 5, check your list of
  enabled extensions at the bottom of /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini (and
  in the per-SAPI configuration directory), and try commenting out or
  reordering the extensions until you find a combination that works.

  For example, in the past the mhash extension was incompatible with
  some other common extensions. To work around this, you could list
  the mhash extension first in php.ini.

  If you find an extension-related bug in the Debian packages, and you
  are willing to help debug the problem, please send us a bug report
  that lists all enabled PHP 5 extensions (extension=), in the order
  in which they appear in php.ini, as well as all enabled Apache
  modules (LoadModule), with version numbers where possible.

Session storage
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Session files are stored in /var/lib/php5/sessions. For security
  purposes, this directory is unreadable to non-root users. This means
  that PHP 5 running from Apache HTTP Server, for example, will not be
  able to clean up stale session files. Instead, we have a cron job
  run every 30 minutes that cleans up stale session files;
  /etc/cron.d/php5. You may need to modify how often this runs, if
  you've modified session.gc_maxlifetime in your php.ini; otherwise,
  it may be too lax or overly aggressive in cleaning out stale session
  files.

  WARNING: If you modify the session handling in any way (e.g. put
  session files in subdirectories, use different session handler), you
  always have to check and possibly disable or modify the session
  cleanup cron job that is located in /etc/cron.d/php5.

Other caveats
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Configuration directives extension_dir and include_path should be
  commented out, unless you need special settings for them so PHP will
  look in compiled-in paths. If you set them, you should also add
  appropriate PHP install directories there.

PHP 5 and Apache 2 Multiviews (HTTP Content Negotiation)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Apache 2’s mod_negotiation needs files to have a MIME-Type (amongst
 others) associated with them in order to be considered for HTTP
 content negotiation.

 Per default, the Debian PHP packages use Apache 2 handlers
 (SetHandler directive) to enable PHP interpretation, while no
 MIME-Type is being associated with the common PHP file extensions.

 Thus, by default, the HTTP content negotiation is disabled for PHP
 file extensions.

 Possible use cases:

 1) You intend to use HTTP content negotiation in order to tidy up URLs:

    For example, you wanted the file “http://example.org/foo.php”
    being accessible as “http://example.org/foo”, too.  In that case
    you really shouldn’t abuse mod_negotiation but use mod_rewrite.

    An example of rewrite-rules, which allow any file ending in “.php”
    to be accessed without this extension is:

      RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_FILENAME}" !-f
      RewriteCond "%{REQUEST_FILENAME}" !-d
      RewriteRule "^(.*)$" "$1.php" [last]

    Depending on your setup you may need to set other flags, too,
    especially “passthrough” or “qsappend”.

 2) You really wanted to use HTTP content negotiation on PHP files
    (be they interpreted or not).

    An example for this might be, when you have the files

      http://example.org/foo.php
      http://example.org/foo.js

    which both do the same job, but the former is executed as PHP on
    the server-side, while the later is executed as JavaScript on the
    client-side.

    If you really want it, just add MIME type definitions for file
    extensions you need to your Apache 2 configuration.  For example
    to recognize php and phps extensions you would add:

      AddType application/x-php         php
      AddType application/x-php-source  phps

    This scenario is really very rarely used (if at all)!

PHP 5 CGI and Apache HTTP Server
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  In simple cases, what you probably want isn't the php5-cgi package
  at all, but rather the libapache2-mod-php5 package, which will
  configure itself on installation and Just Work(tm). However, if you
  have a need to use the CGI version of PHP 5 with Apache HTTP Server,
  the following should help get you going, though there are dozens of
  different ways to do this.

  The current recommended approach is to install the php5-fpm package
  and use FastCGI to interface to your webserver. However, you will
  have to use the libapache2-mod-fastcgi package (from non-free) or a
  different FastCGI-capable webserver (such as nginx or lighttpd),
  since the libapache2-mod-fcgid available from the main archive has
  no way of interacting with external FastCGI servers.

  Please note that this process will never be made automatic, as
  php5-cgi is meant to be a webserver-agnostic package that can be
  used with any httpd, and we don't want it to conflict with the
  httpd-specific packages such as libapache2-mod-php5. If both were
  installed side-by-side and both were automatically enabled, the
  results would be a bit confusing, obviously.

  You should also be aware that a server deployed in CGI mode is open
  to several possible vulnerabilities. See the upstream CGI security
  page to learn how to defend yourself from such attacks:
  http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.cgi-bin.php

  To use php5-cgi with Apache HTTP Server:
  1) activate php5_cgi module: run 'a2enconf php5-cgi'
  2) this will also activate the mod_actions module as a dependency
  3) comment out the last block of configuration in the
     /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/php5-cgi.conf file to enable
     server-wide PHP 5 CGI or add the mentioned configuration block to
     one or more virtual hosts or directories.
  4) It's advised to not mix-and-match multiple SAPIs (such as
     php5-cgi along with libapache2-mod-php5) in the same apache2
     configuration as it is likely to create unpredictable results.

Configuration Layout
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Each SAPI (apache2/apache2filter/cgi/cli/fpm) has a different
  central configuration file /etc/php5/$SAPI/php.ini.

  Additionally, each SAPI is configured with the compile-time option 

    --with-config-file-scan-dir=/etc/php5/$SAPI/conf.d

  which for all SAPIs is actually a symlink pointing to a central
  directory /etc/php5/conf.d. Any file found in this directory ending
  in .ini will be treated as a configuration file by the PHP SAPI.

  The rationale behind this method is that each SAPI can thus be
  identically configured with a minimal amount of conffile handling,
  but at the same time if you want to have SAPI-specific
  configuration, you can just remove the symlink.

  Note that the usage of the PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR environment variable
  overrides what is set with --with-config-file-scan-dir and thus the
  directory /etc/php5/$SAPI/conf.d will no longer be included.

Timezone data from system timezone database
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Debian PHP has been patched to use the system wide timezone database
  from the tzdata package, making sure any updates there are
  automatically used by PHP as well.

  Note that this requires that the PHP process has access to
  /etc/localtime and /usr/share/zoneinfo. For any regular installation
  this should be the case, but in specific secured environments when
  reading the timezone database is impossible PHP will give a
  "Timezone database is corrupt - this should *never* happen!" error.
